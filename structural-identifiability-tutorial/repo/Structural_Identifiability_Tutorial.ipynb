    "## 1. Motivation: Why Identifiability Matters <a id=\"1-motivation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hidden Trap in Parameter Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have built a mathematical model of how a drug moves through the human body. The model has several parameters: absorption rates, elimination rates, volumes of distribution. You collect data from a clinical trial, run your favorite optimization algorithm, and obtain parameter estimates. The algorithm converges, the fit looks great, and you report the results in a paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But here is the problem:** What if the same data could be explained equally well by completely different parameter values? What if there are infinitely many parameter combinations that produce the exact same model output?\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is the case, your parameter estimates are **arbitrary**. A different starting point for the optimizer would have given you different numbers, and both would fit the data equally well. Any scientific conclusions drawn from those specific numbers would be unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider measuring the concentration of a substance that decays over time. If we observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = A \\cdot e^{-kt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we know $A$ and can measure $y(t)$, then $k$ is uniquely determined: there is exactly one value of $k$ that produces the observed curve. The parameter $k$ is **identifiable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the observation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = a \\cdot x_0 \\cdot e^{-kt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where both $a$ (a scaling factor) and $x_0$ (initial condition) are unknown? Then we can only determine the product $a \\cdot x_0$, not $a$ and $x_0$ individually. If someone reports $a = 2$ and $x_0 = 5$, another researcher could equally claim $a = 1$ and $x_0 = 10$. Both are consistent with the data. The individual parameters $a$ and $x_0$ are **nonidentifiable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural vs. Practical Identifiability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two distinct questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | **Structural Identifiability** | **Practical Identifiability** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Question** | Can parameters *theoretically* be determined from the model structure and observations? | Can parameters be estimated *reliably* from the actual data at hand? |\n",
    "| **Depends on** | Model equations + what is measured | Data quality, noise, sample size |\n",
    "| **Data assumed** | Perfect, continuous, noise-free | Real: finite, discrete, noisy |\n",
    "| **Method** | Algebraic/analytical | Statistical/numerical |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** If a parameter is structurally nonidentifiable, it is *guaranteed* to be practically nonidentifiable too. No amount of data can fix a structural problem. This is why structural analysis should come first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on **structural identifiability**: determining whether your model structure permits unique parameter recovery, before you ever look at data."

    "## 2. Mathematical Background <a id=\"2-mathematical-background\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The General ODE Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider models of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}(0) = \\mathbf{x}_0(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the **state vector** (the variables that evolve over time)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{u}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is the **input** (known external forcing, like a drug dose)\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the **parameter vector** (the unknowns we want to estimate)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{y}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^q$ is the **output** (what we can actually measure)\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions $\\mathbf{f}$ and $\\mathbf{g}$ define the model dynamics and observations, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** Identifiability depends on *both* the dynamics ($\\mathbf{f}$) *and* the observations ($\\mathbf{g}$). The same dynamical system can be identifiable or nonidentifiable depending on what you measure!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Three Levels of Identifiability\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a model, each parameter $\\theta_i$ falls into exactly one of three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Globally Identifiable (GI)\n",
    "A parameter $\\theta_i$ is **globally identifiable** if, for almost all true parameter values $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y}(t; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\mathbf{y}(t; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*) \\text{ for all } t \\geq 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\theta_i = \\theta_i^*$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*In plain language:* If two parameter vectors produce identical outputs, then $\\theta_i$ must have the same value in both. There is exactly **one** value of $\\theta_i$ consistent with the data. This is the best case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Locally Identifiable (LI)\n",
    "A parameter $\\theta_i$ is **locally identifiable** if there exists a neighborhood around $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$ in which it is the unique solution. However, there may be **finitely many** other isolated values of $\\theta_i$ (outside this neighborhood) that also produce the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In plain language:* The parameter can take a small **finite** number of discrete values consistent with the data. For example, both $\\theta_i = 3$ and $\\theta_i = 7$ might work, but nothing in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nonidentifiable (NI)\n",
    "A parameter $\\theta_i$ is **nonidentifiable** if infinitely many values of $\\theta_i$, forming a continuous set, produce the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In plain language:* The parameter can vary over an entire range (or manifold) without changing the output at all. Estimation is fundamentally impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Identifiable Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When individual parameters are nonidentifiable, certain **combinations** of parameters may still be recoverable. These are called **identifiable functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If $a$ and $x_0$ are nonidentifiable but $a \\cdot x_0$ is identifiable, then:\n",
    "- You **cannot** estimate $a$ or $x_0$ separately\n",
    "- You **can** estimate the product $a \\cdot x_0$\n",
    "- The product $a \\cdot x_0$ is an identifiable function\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding identifiable functions tells you exactly what information the data *can* provide, even when the full parameter vector cannot be recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 The Differential Algebra Approach (How the Software Works)\n",
    "\n",
    "The software we will use (`StructuralIdentifiability.jl`) employs the **differential algebra** method. Here is the intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminate hidden states:** Using algebraic manipulation, remove all state variables that are not directly observed, obtaining equations that involve only the input $\\mathbf{u}$, the output $\\mathbf{y}$, their time derivatives, and the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract the coefficient map:** These \"input-output equations\" have the form:\n",
    "$$\\sum_i c_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\cdot m_i(y, \\dot{y}, \\ddot{y}, \\ldots, u, \\dot{u}, \\ldots) = 0$$\n",
    "where the coefficients $c_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ depend only on the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test injectivity:** Since the $c_i$ are observable from data, identifiability reduces to asking: does the map $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mapsto (c_1(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), \\ldots, c_r(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))$ uniquely determine $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "The software automates all of these steps."

    "\n",
    "When your identifiability analysis reveals nonidentifiable parameters, **do not despair**. There are several principled strategies for moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 1: Fix Parameters from External Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "If a reliable estimate of a nonidentifiable parameter exists from independent experiments or published literature, you can fix it to that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In the viral dynamics model, if the viral clearance rate $c$ is known from independent pharmacokinetic studies, fixing $c$ may make the remaining parameters identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- The external estimate must be credible and well-documented\n",
    "- You should perform a sensitivity analysis (how do your conclusions change if the fixed value is wrong?)\n",
    "- You must report that the parameter was fixed, not estimated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 2: Reparameterize Using Identifiable Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace nonidentifiable individual parameters with identifiable combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If $\\beta$ and $p$ are nonidentifiable but $\\beta \\cdot p$ is identifiable:\n",
    "- Define $q = \\beta \\cdot p$ as a new parameter\n",
    "- Rewrite the model in terms of $q$\n",
    "- Estimate $q$ instead of trying to estimate $\\beta$ and $p$ separately\n",
    "- Interpret results in terms of $q$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often the most scientifically honest approach, because you are estimating exactly what the data can tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 3: Add Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Design experiments to measure additional state variables. The identifiability analysis tells you exactly which measurements would help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Viral dynamics with $V$ observed only → add $T$ measurements to resolve nonidentifiability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 4: Bayesian Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Use informative prior distributions in a Bayesian framework to constrain nonidentifiable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical caveat:** For structurally nonidentifiable parameters, the posterior will be dominated by the prior, not the data. You are not \"estimating\" the parameter from data — you are essentially reporting your prior belief. This must be transparently communicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 5: Simplify the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce complexity by:\n",
    "- Combining compartments that the data cannot distinguish\n",
    "- Applying quasi-steady-state approximations to fast variables\n",
    "- Eliminating parameters that the data cannot inform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If $\\beta$ and $p$ always appear as $\\beta \\cdot p$, replace the two-step infection process with a single step using rate $q = \\beta \\cdot p$.\n",

    "### The Complete Identifiability Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the workflow we recommend for every modeling project:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Before collecting data**\n",
    "1. Write down your model equations explicitly\n",
    "2. Specify exactly what you can measure (observation functions)\n",
    "3. Run structural identifiability analysis\n",
    "4. If nonidentifiabilities are found, consider modifying the experimental design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: After collecting data**\n",
    "5. Perform practical identifiability analysis (profile likelihood, Fisher information)\n",
    "6. Estimate parameters only for those that pass both structural and practical checks\n",
    "7. Report identifiable functions for nonidentifiable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: Reporting**\n",
    "8. State that identifiability analysis was performed\n",
    "9. Report the classification of each parameter\n",
    "10. Explain how nonidentifiable parameters were handled\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference Card\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task | Function | When to Use |\n",
    "|------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Fast screening | `assess_local_identifiability(model)` | First check; catches obvious problems |\n",
    "| Full analysis | `assess_identifiability(model)` | Definitive classification (GI, LI, NI) |\n",
    "| What can be estimated? | `find_identifiable_functions(model)` | When nonidentifiability is found |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fitting a nonidentifiable model.** The optimizer will converge, but the estimates are meaningless. Always check identifiability first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confusing structural and practical identifiability.** A structurally identifiable parameter can still be practically nonidentifiable with your specific data. Both checks are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ignoring the observation function.** The same dynamics can be identifiable or not, depending on what you measure. Always specify observations explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Treating fixed parameters as estimated.** If you fix a parameter from the literature, do not report it as \"estimated\" or include it in confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Assuming more outputs always help.** Adding observations generally improves identifiability, but redundant observations (e.g., two measurements that are proportional) may not help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "| Example | Model | Key Lesson |\n",
    "|---------|-------|------------|\n",
    "| 1 | Simple decay ($y = x$) | Direct observation → full identifiability |\n",
    "| 2 | Scaled decay ($y = ax$) | Unknown scaling → product identifiable, individuals not |\n",
    "| 3 | SIR epidemic | Identifiability depends critically on what is measured |\n",
    "| 4 | Two-compartment PK | Known inputs (doses) improve identifiability |\n",
    "| 5 | Viral dynamics | Guides experimental design: which measurements are needed? |\n",
    "| 6 | SEIR-H | Multiple data streams resolve different parameters |\n",
    "| 7 | Environmental transmission | Wastewater data resolves fundamental ambiguities |"
